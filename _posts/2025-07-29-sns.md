title: STEP 5- EventBridge & SNS
---

EventBridge is an application that receives events from AWS services and routes them to a target based on defined rules. When creating a chatbot, we want EventBridge to notify us when there are certain security threat events occurring, such as updating or deleting a guardrail. Suppose someone hacks into your system and deletes a guardrail to access personal information, such as client addresses and bank balances. Implementing EventBridge would alert you to these events.

#### Create an SNS Topic

1. Navigate to SNS Dashboard
2. Create a new Topic
   - Click the “Topics” link in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Click the “Create topic” button.
3. Configure the Topic Settings
   - Topic type: Choose Standard.
   - Name: Enter a unique name like security-alerts-topic.
   - Leave other defaults unless needed.
   - Click “Create topic”.
4. Add a Subscription
   - On the topic details page, click “Create subscription”.
   - Protocol: Choose Email.
   - Endpoint: Enter the email address that should receive notifications.
   - Click “Create subscription”.
5. Confirm Email Subscription
   - Check your email inbox.
   - Click the confirmation link in the message from AWS to activate the subscription.
6. Test the Topic
   - In the SNS topic page, click “Publish message”.
   - Enter a subject and message body, then click “Publish” to test if the email is received.
