title: STEP 4- SNS
---

Now that we have CloudTrail logging all of our AWS events, we need to set up a system that alerts us of security concerns. First, we must set up an SNS topic. **Simple Notication Service** allows publishers to send messages to subscribers. When enabled with CloudWatch, when certain events are identified (such as DeleteGuardrail), AWS will send a message straight to your email.

#### Create an SNS Topic

1. Navigate to SNS Dashboard
2. Create a new Topic
   - Click the “Topics” link in the left-hand sidebar.
   - Click the “Create topic” button.
3. Configure the Topic Settings
   - Topic type: Choose Standard.
   - Name: Enter a unique name like security-alerts-topic.
   - Leave other defaults unless needed.
   - Click “Create topic”.
4. Add a Subscription
   - On the topic details page, click “Create subscription”.
   - Protocol: Choose Email.
   - Endpoint: Enter the email address that should receive notifications.
   - Click “Create subscription”.
5. Confirm Email Subscription
   - Check your email inbox.
   - Click the confirmation link in the message from AWS to activate the subscription.
6. Test the Topic
   - In the SNS topic page, click “Publish message”.
   - Enter a subject and message body, then click “Publish” to test if the email is received.

This is what the subscription confirmation should look like
