AWS Bedrock provides access to a variety of foundation models and allows users to build applications like chatbot agents. Bedrock supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/"><b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b></a> through its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/"><b>Knowledge Bases (KB)</b></a> feature. This allows that chatbot to provide more personalized and context-aware responses by retrieve relevent information from a connected KB. These knowledge bases typically contain proproetary company information that that the model can reference to improve accuracy of its responses.
