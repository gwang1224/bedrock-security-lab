        <h3>What is Amazon Bedrock?</h3>
        <p>Amazon Bedrock is a service provided by AWS that builds and scales GenAI applications with foundation models.</p>

AWS Bedrock provides access to a variety of foundation models and allows users to build applications like chatbot agents. Bedrock supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/"><b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b></a> through its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/"><b>Knowledge Bases (KB)</b></a> feature. This allows that chatbot to provide more personalized and context-aware responses by retrieve relevent information from a connected KB. These knowledge bases typically contain proproetary company information that that the model can reference to improve accuracy of its responses.

#### 1. Requesting foundation models

<video controls>

</video>

- Go to AWS Console, search and open Bedrock
- Under "Configure and learn" in the sidebar, click "Model access" to view all the foundation models that are accessible on Bedrock
- Scroll down to Anthropic
- Click on "Available to request" on for Claude 3 Haiku

Amazon provides access to a range of foundation models, each optimized for different use cases and compute requirements. Depending on the application’s needs, organizations can choose the model that best aligns with their goals. For this lab, we will use Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, a lightweight and cost-effective model well-suited for chatbot applications. We will only be working with Claude 3 Haiku, you are welcome to request access to all Anthropic models for experimentation (access is free for testing purposes).

- Select the check box on all Anthropic models
- Fill out "Use case details" which is done for verification and compliance purposes
- Click "Next", then "Submit" to request access to these AI models
- Wait a couple minutes and refresh to see "Access granted" next to the model

#### 2. Create an S3 Bucket for KB

We’ve created a few files for the Knowledge Base. Click the button to download the files and explore the contents inside. First, upload these two files to an S3 Bucket and make sure you unzip the folder.

- <b>common_questions.txt </b> : a compilation of frequently asked questions, e.g., When are bank hours? Are there fees charged to open an account?
- <b>customers.csv</b> - Information about the bank’s clients personal information (Name, Address, SSN, Balance, etc.)

\*Refer to Lab 1.1 for help on this step

#### 3. Create a Knowledge Base (KB)

<video controls>
  <source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/videos/create-kb.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

- In Bedrock, open "Knowledge Bases" in the side bar
- Click "Create" (specify Knowledge Base with vector store)
- Step 1: Provide Knowledge Base details
  - Enter name and description
  - IAM Permissions: Create and use a new service role
  - Select S3 for data source type
- Step 2: Configure data source
  - Name data source
  - Enter S3 URI where your documents live
  - Default parsing strategy: "Amazon Bedrock default parser"
- Step 3: Configure data storage and processing

  - Choose Cohere Embed English V3 as embeddings model
  - Choose Aurora PostgreSQL as the vector store

    \*Any vector store can be used. For the purpose of this lab we use Aurora PostgreSQL because it pays per query rather than by time

  - Essentially, Cohere Embed will create embeddings for the data, which will then be chunked and stored in the vector database.

- Step 4: Review and create
  - Click "Create Knowledge Base"

The process of creating a KB can take a couple of minutes. A message at the top should tell you the expected wait time.

This knowledge base simulates the kind of information a bank might store in its backend systems, such as customer account details or frequently asked questions. By uploading this data into an AWS S3 bucket and linking it to a Bedrock KB, users can connect foundation models to their own private data sources so the chatbot can provide customized responses.

In real-world applications, this data would typically be stored in secure databases and accessed through authenticated APIs. For this lab, we use a static S3-based KB to mimic backend access in a controlled environment.

<br>

#### 4. Sync KB

Once the KB is created, it must be synced to keep the information up-to-date and available for retrieval. Click on the KB and go to the "Data Source" section. Check the data source and click "Sync" in the top right.

#### 5. Create an Agent

Creating an agent formally connects the KB to the model. Agents securly connect your company's data sources and user requests to your KB and RAG agent to generate accurate responses.

- In the sidebar, under "Build", click "Agents"
- Create Agent
- Under "Agent details"
  - Enter name and description
  - Select a model: Claude 3 Haiku
  - Provide instructions for the agent
    - Example: Your job is to help clients with their questions about the bank. Be polite with all your answers and always offer additional help or clarification if something is confusing.
- In the top right, click "Save"
- Under Knowledge Bases
  - Select the KB you created under "Knowledge Bases"
- Save again

This is what your Agent Builder should look like...

<details>
<summary>Now test out the agent! Attempt to obtain sensitive information (ex. SSN, address, balance). What data were you able to reveal?</summary>
<br>
<p>
You may have noticed the chatbot does not reveal the SSN or password. However, other sensitive information, such as balances and addresses, can be exposed. Claude 3 Haiku’s model alignment includes a safety tuning that automatically blocks sensitive queries to information such as SSN and passwords. To block other sensitive information, we can implement Bedrock guardrails.</p>
